Artesteps: 3D Gallery Planimetry of the Circulatory System

Artesteps is an innovative project designed to create a 3D interactive gallery of the human circulatory system. This project combines art and technology to bring anatomical structures to life through 3D modeling and interactive design, allowing users to explore and learn about the human circulatory system in an engaging and informative way.

# Features
3D Gallery: Explore the circulatory system in an interactive 3D environment.
Anatomical Accuracy: Detailed and accurate models of the heart, veins, arteries, and capillaries.
Interactive Design: Users can navigate and zoom in on different parts of the circulatory system.
Educational Tool: Provides a fun and engaging way to learn about human anatomy.

# Technologies Used
3D Modeling Software: artsteps
Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Website Prototype: https://sistemocircolatorio.wixsite.com/sisteme-circolatorio

# Project Structure
/assets: Contains 3D models and textures used in the gallery.
/src: Contains the source code for the interactive elements and UI.
/docs: Documentation on the circulatory system for educational purposes.
index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point to the interactive gallery.
